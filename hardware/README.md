**Hardware AlphaKit V.04**

We designed a shield for the Particle Core/Photon where you can attach following sensors:

- 2x Temp DS18B20
- 2x Temp and Humidity DHT22
- 2x Audio sensor (like audio breakout from SparkFun - more details in audio_sensor)
- 1x Weight sensor

There's also an micro SD Card Slot and a RTC Clock Device installed to be able to work in offline areas.

You'll find a Bill of materials list in bom.ods

**Important for producing the PCB**
It's a doublesided PCB so you need to make sure that pins and vias are through contacted!
