<h4>  <u>Spark Core Alpha 1.0 Version</u></h4>  
  <p>The Alpha sensor kit uses 2x DHT22 Temperature and Humidity sensors and 2x DS18B20 Temperature Sensors.  The application is built upon a unified sensor framework that allows for adding different sensors in the future.</p>
  <pre>  One of the DHT22 sensors is used for monitoring outdoor Temperature and Humidity
  One of the DHT22 sensors is used for monitoring hive Temperature and Humidity
  Two of the DS18B20 sensors are for monitoring Temperatures in other locations
  of the beehive.
  Data is collected every ten minutes and reported to a internet server running
  the SparkFun Phant database. </pre>
